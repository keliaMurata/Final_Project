#Simulated Delayed Hand Reaction 
####A stroke victim advocate 
In order to empower one must first educate. I wrote this program in th hopes to help others understand some of the struggles faced by individuals that have suffered strokes and lost the ability to completely control their limbs.  Brain damage can occur quickly when blood flow is restricted or cut off from different areas in the brain, causing irreversable damage to outer body functions such as motor, speech and concentration abilities. This is a program meant to educate and simulate what the disjunct and delay between the input (singnal from the brain) and the output (the movement of the limb) is like for stroke victims struggling with fine motor movment. 
This program is meant to empower those suffering with this affliction by enlightening others to thier daily struggle. It switches between realtime movement and the delay hand movement to show the slowed and 'normal' movement of the hand in contrast.
